        <Paragraph>
            I've wanted to forge as far back as I can remember. 
            About a year ago I decided to take the plunge and pick up the hammer. 
            I had no clue what I was doing and knew no smiths. 
            So, when someone suggested to cut a propane tank in two lined with refectory cement and use it as a forge, I did. 
            Little did I know there's a far easier method for starting out, but hindsight is never helpful the first time.
        </Paragraph>
        <Callout>
            I had no clue what I was doing
        </Callout>
        <Paragraph>
            The split tank sat on top of a milk crate, with copper pipping running beneath for airflow. 
            I had planned to use the bicycle foot pump seen in the picture below, but I quickly realized it didn't nearly supply enough air, or more accurately I couldn't keep up with the pumping. 
            So shortly thereafter I switched to a very large air compressor that nearly turned my petty forge into a foundry. 
            And I should mention that I was using charcoal briquettes which was a limitation on the level of heat I could reach and routinely filled the forge belly with ash.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
            Not long after I moved the forge into a more usable smithy. 
            My small anvil sat directly on the ground, held down by only some snow, bouncing with every strike. 
            At least, though, I realized I needed to move away from using briquettes. 
            After switching to real charcoal (lump charcoal) things at least got a bit hotter.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
            This all work quite poorly, but just enough to get me hooked. 
            I managed to forge a butterknife out of an old bolt with this setup. 
            Course the knife was rather accidental. 
            I didn't plan to make anything really, I just kept striking hot steel and it just kinda popped out.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
            As much as I liked the ease of using an electrical air compressor, it was really loud and I find I tend towards doing things by hand. 
            Consequently I read and researched many different forms of bellows. 
            A large western double lung would have been great, yet I didn't posses the skills to make one, nor the materials. 
            Thus I settled on a more practical design, the fuigo box. Japanese swordsmith bellows, efficient, cheap, and cool sounding. 
            Though I still didn't think I could make one yet with the little talent I possessed.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            Instead I came up with my own design, a bucket bellows. 
            Following the same principles as the fuigo box but using resources more readily available for me. 
            And I finally moved the anvil on to a stump, no longer overly breaking my back.
        </Paragraph>
        <ImageWithCaption image={bucketBellowsImage} caption="Bucket bellows and my tiny anvil on a stump at last" />
        <Paragraph>
            Now, I still think the bucket bellows were a really good idea, but with subpar construction and overuse they broke quite quickly. 
            By moving the anvil to the stump, I was no longer within reach of the air compressor, so I had to find a new solution. 
            Simple, invert the shop vac. 
            This lead to a new issue that took me a long time to realized, I had too much airflow now. 
            Too much airflow will burn through fuel fast and the air was cooling off the steel.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
            Things were working better. 
            Feeling like I knew to some degree what I was doing, I decided to forge a pair of tongs. 
            It did not go well. 
            Things were good at first but I found that I had forged the ends too thin. 
            Discouraged but enduring, I left the left one half too long in the forge. 
            It burned quite a bit off, driving home the proverbial final nail. 
            Although in making the tongs, I started building up the forge with rocks, a key moment in the evolution of my smithy.
        </Paragraph>
        <ImageWithCaption image={propaneForgeWithStonesImage} caption="Propane tank forge with stone walls" />
        <Paragraph>
            After the tongs ordeal, I for some reason decided to do something even crazier. 
            I decided that I would forge a seax. 
            This project ended up taking many months. 
            I bought a leaf spring from the local auto dump for $10 and hot cut it to length. 
            Also, I made a stand for the anvil.
        </Paragraph>
        <ImageWithCaption image={newAnvilStandImage} caption="Tiny anvil sitting on my new stand" />
        <Paragraph>
            The stand worked horribly and I quickly realized I needed to go back to the stump. 
            But I was quickly outgrowing the forge. 
            I kept building and adding more rocks to it. 
            Then it hit me, finally, that I don't need refectory cement or steel to make a forge, all I need is mud!
        </Paragraph>
        <Callout>
            all I need is mud!

        <Paragraph>
            So I made a new forge out of mud and rocks and it was so very much better.

        <Paragraph>
            By building it out of dirt, it became easy to change and iterate. 
            At first I tried adding a roof to keep the heat in. 
            It seemed unnecessary and the high heat kept shattering the top stone. 
            So I kept it open and slowly built up the sides with more mud so that charcoal could sit in a heap.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            For a while at this point I had been looking for a better anvil. 
            Finally I found one. 
            A 150 lb Wilkinson Queen Dudley for $500. 
            It was in near perfect condition so the price was fair. 
            This was a dramatic improvement.
        </Paragraph>
        <ImageWithCaption image={anvilUpCloseImage} caption="Wilkonson Queen Dudley anvil" />
        <Paragraph>
            But something was still missing; I didn't want to be tethered to an electrical cord. 
            So I made up my mind that it was time to build my fuigo box, the more proper way. 
            And I did, it worked out great. 
            In total it was about two days of work and I did all of it by hand. 
            The largest change I made to the traditional design is I had the piston handle extend out the back same as the front instead of only the front. 
            This way, the bellows were bi-directional, same as the forge. 
            Of course this is far less practical indoors but I had all the space in the world outside.

        <ImageWithCaption image={forgeWithFuigoBoxImage} caption="All set up with the fuigo box" />
        <Paragraph>
            Another thing I notice is that I kept having trouble keeping the steel above the rim of the tuyere (the pipe from which the air flows). 
            Thus I raised the front and back of the forge so that a pit sat in the centre, with a depth equal to the diameter of the tuyere. 
            It became more of an updraft forge than a side blast. 
            This didn't really fix the problem. 
            Instead it created a new one; ash and debris would fill the pit causing the air to blast upwards along the side of the forge. 
            Then I put into place my final idea. 
            I capped the tuyere and drilled holes along the top of the end so that air would ooze up and out. 
            This finally did the trick.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
            Only one thing was left, raising the forge up off the ground. 
            My table building skills shouldn't even be dignified by calling them lacking, but alas I managed to slap something together. 
            It proved that it could work, I no longer had to jump up every time I was ready to hammer at the anvil.
        </Paragraph>

            it was, well, wobbly.
        </Callout>
        <Paragraph>
            There was a problem though, it was, well, wobbly. 
            Which really isn't the way I'd want to describe something holding heat upwards of 2000 degrees Fahrenheit from falling on me. 
            So after a while of me trying to find a solution - I was planning to do some elaborate joiner that would have taken me ages - my grandfather told me he had a pair of old steel workhorses. 
            After installing those under the forge, it's a solid as I can hope for.
        </Paragraph>
        <ImageWithCaption image={forgeWithTheSteelHorsesImage} caption="Table reinforced with steel horses" />
        <Paragraph>
            And this is the state of my forge, nearly a year after I started blacksmithing. 
            I think it's come a long way, though the road ahead still appears unending.
